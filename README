== BUILD INSTRUCTIONS ==

In order to build Rescatux in a Squeeze system or Squeeze chroot you need these packages:

live-helper
imagemagick # Needed for logo generation
syslinux # Needed for logo generation

=== Build chntpw-ng ===

It doesn't matter too much if you build it from squeeze or from an unstable system.
Probably it will work in squeeze ok.

You will find chntpw-ng source code at: http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=11211 .

Just check INSTALL.txt file on the package for build instructions.

Build will generate chntpw binary file.

Path to this file should be set at: make_common's CHNTPWNG_BINARY variable.

=== Build backported passwd package ===

This needs to be done on an squeeze system or chroot.

First of all we need to install dpkg-dev backported package.

1)
Edit /etc/apt/sources.list and add:
  deb http://backports.debian.org/debian-backports squeeze-backports main
line.
2)
  apt-get update
  apt-get -t squeeze-backports install dpkg-dev

3) 
  apt-get install devscripts build-essential
4)
Get shadow source code (adapt to your repository and latest version on squeeze):
  dget -x http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/pool/main/s/shadow/shadow_4.1.5-1.dsc
5)
Some more dependencies...
  apt-get install autoconf automake1.9 libtool \
  gettext libpam0g-dev debhelper quilt dpkg-dev \
  xsltproc docbook-xsl docbook-xml libxml2-utils \
  cdbs libselinux1-dev libsemanage1-dev \
  gnome-doc-utils

6)
  cd shadow-4.1.5
  dch --bpo
7)
  fakeroot debian/rules binary
8)
  dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc

This will generate a deb package file like:
passwd_4.1.5-1~bpo60+1_i386.deb

Path to this package should be set at: make_common's BACKPORTED_PASSWD variable.


=== Isolinux based image ===

Edit these variables from make_common file if needed:

MIRROR_BOOTSTRAP
MIRROR_CHROOT
SID_MIRROR
BACKPORTED_PASSWD
CHNTPWNG_BINARY

Using an squeeze system or chroot run at the Rescatux source code directory:

  ./make_rescatux_hybrid.sh

This will generate an image like:
  rescatux_cdrom_usb_hybrid_i386_486-amd64_0.30b7.iso

=== SG2D based image ===

You need to have installed GNU GRUB2 in your system, at least the grub-mkrescue and grub-mkfont binaries.
You also need to have Super Grub2 Disk source code.

Edit SG2D_SOURCE_DIRECTORY variable in make_rescatux_sg2d_hybrid.sh file.
Its value should be path to your Super Grub2 Disk source code directory.

Using an unstable/wheezey system or chroot run at the Rescatux source code directory:

  ./make_rescatux_sg2d_hybrid.sh

This will generate an image like:
  rescatux_cdrom_usb_hybrid_i386_486-amd64_0.30b8_sg2d.iso

=== Make source code ===

Just run:

  ./make_source_code.sh

in order to generate a file like:

  rescatux_source_code_0.30b6.tar.gz


=== Release ===

The files that usually conform a release are:

Rescatux iso based on Super Grub2 Disk:

  rescatux_cdrom_usb_hybrid_i386_486-amd64_0.30b8_sg2d.iso

Rescatux iso based on Super Grub2 Disk md5sum file:

  rescatux_cdrom_usb_hybrid_i386_486-amd64_0.30b8_sg2d.iso.md5

Rescatux source code:

  rescatux_source_code_0.30b8.tar.gz

=== Other notes ===

You can change Rescatux version at VERSION file.
