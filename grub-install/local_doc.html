<ul>
  <li>
  <b>Step 1</b><p></p>Rescapp searchs for partitions that have on them the following file: <i>/etc/issue</i> based on information found in <i>/proc/partitions</i> file.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 2</b><p></p>If such partitions have been found Rescapp presents you partitions that have on them the following file: <i>/etc/issue</i>. At the same time you are prompted:<p></p>
  <i>Which partition is your main GNU/Linux?</i><p></p> You are supposed to choose your main GNU/Linux distribution (probably you only will see one) and press the OK button.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 3</b><p></p>Rescapp searchs for hard disks present on your system based on information found on <i>/proc/partitions</i> file.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 4</b><p></p>You are prompted:<p></p><i>Which hard disk to install Linux on?</i><p></p> You are supposed to take a look at hard disk sizes (to be able to identify your hard disks) and choose (usually) the one that it is set to be first one to boot at your BIOS settings.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 5</b><p></p>You are prompted:<p></p><i>These are detected hard disks. Prepare to order them according to boot order. Press OK to continue.</i><p></p>. Take a look at hard disks and their sizes. Please be sure to memorise their sizes because they are not going to be appear later. You do not have to do anything. Just press OK for now.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 6</b><p></p>For each one of the hard disks found at your computer you are prompted:<p></p><i>Which is the right position for this hard disk?</i><p></p>. Take a look at hard disk name and select its boot order.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 7</b><p></p>Rescapp with all gathered information is going to create a temporal device.map at your Linux installation (which will be deleted later) and try to install grub on your selected hard disk thanks to your own distribution grub-install command.<b>Please wait</b>. Currently (Rescatux 0.23) this step is time consuming but no Please wait message has been implemented.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 8</b><p></p>You are informed about the grub installation process.<p></p>Message is self explanatory. You either get:<p></p><i>Success! Grub was installed OK! :)</i><p></p>or<p></p><i>Failure! Grub was not installed. Something went wrong! :(</i>
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 9</b><p></p>A log file called <i>grub-install.log.txt</i> can be found at Desktop <i>logs</i> folder.
  </li>
</ul>
