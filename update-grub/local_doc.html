<ul>
  <li>
  <b>Step 1</b><p></p>Rescapp searchs for partitions that have on them the following file: <i>/etc/issue</i> based on information found in <i>/proc/partitions</i> file.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 2</b><p></p>If such partitions have been found Rescapp presents you partitions that have on them the following file: <i>/etc/issue</i>. At the same time you are prompted:<p></p>
  <i>Which partition is your main GNU/Linux?</i><p></p> You are supposed to choose your main GNU/Linux distribution (probably you only will see one) and press the OK button.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 3</b><p></p>Rescapp searchs for hard disks present on your system based on information found on <i>/proc/partitions</i> file.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 4</b><p></p>You are prompted:<p></p><i>These are detected hard disks. Prepare to order them according to boot order. Press OK to continue.</i><p></p>. Take a look at hard disks and their sizes. You do not have to do anything. Just press OK for now.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 5</b><p></p>For each one of the hard disks found at your computer you are prompted:<p></p><i>Which is the right position for this hard disk?</i><p></p>. Take a look at hard disk name and select its boot order.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 6</b><p></p>Rescapp with all gathered information is going to create a temporal device.map at your Linux installation (which will be deleted later) and try to update your grub configuration file on your selected hard disk thanks to your own distribution update-grub command.<b>Please wait</b>. Currently (Rescatux 0.23) this step is time consuming but no Please wait message has been implemented.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 7</b><p></p>You are informed about the grub configuration file update process.<p></p>Message is self explanatory. You either get:<p></p><i>Success! Grub configuration was updated ok! :)</i><p></p>or<p></p><i>Failure! Grub configuration update went wrong! :(</i>
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 8</b><p></p>A log file called <i>update-grub.log.txt</i> can be found at Desktop <i>logs</i> folder.
  </li>
</ul>
